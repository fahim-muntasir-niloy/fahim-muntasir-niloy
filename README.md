As an aspiring data scientist, my research interests are centred around the application of machine learning in ways that directly benefit and engage with people. I believe that the true potential of machine learning can be unlocked when we integrate its capabilities into various domains, fostering cross‑disciplinary collaboration for innovative solutions. I am focused on developing AI systems that are not only highly functional but also intuitive, interpretable and transparent.
